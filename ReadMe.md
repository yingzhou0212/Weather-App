Assignment/Project #:  Project3

Description: 
_This Weather App is a multilingual application that displays real-time weather information for several major cities. The app includes customizable units, theme colors, full-screen feature views, and a dedicated information section. The interface supports English, Spanish, and French. At the bottom of the app, there are four navigation buttons, each leading to a different screen to help users interact with weather data, app settings, or additional features.
    
Notification/Alert:
_When the app is launched for the first time, it automatically prompts the user with a system alert asking for notification permission.
    -If the user allows notifications, the app may send weather-related notifications depending on the current temperature.
    -If the user later decides not to receive notifications, they must manually turn them off in the iOS Settings -> Notifications -> Weather App.
    
_The app only displays alerts when it fails to retrieve weather data from the API.
This can occur when:
    -The user has poor or no internet connection, or
    -Any other issue prevents the app from successfully fetching data.
In these cases, an alert appears to inform the user of the failure and provide an option to retry.
